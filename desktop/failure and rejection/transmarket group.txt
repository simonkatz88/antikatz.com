Hi Simon,

We were pleased by the overwhelming response 
to the Algorithmic Trader Intern role and 
appreciate the time and effort you put forth 
in your application. Unfortunately, we are no 
longer considering your candidacy because we 
have filled our 2023 summer internship class.

While we couldn't move forward with your candidacy 
for this year, we would like to encourage you to 
apply this upcoming summer for consideration to
our full-time Junior Algorithmic Trader opportunity 
or 2024 Algorithmic Trader summer internship.

We wish you all the best in your career ahead and 
thank you for your interest in our company.

Regards,
TransMarket Group
