Greetings,  

Thank you for taking the time to apply 
and interview for the Orientation Team. 
We had an overwhelmingly positive response 
to our call for applications and had 
the difficult task of selecting a team from 
a pool of highly qualified candidates. 
At this time, unfortunately, we are not able 
to offer you a position on the Orientation 
Team. While news like this is tough to receive,
we hope you will remain involved with 
other leadership opportunities across campus and 
consider reapplying next year. 
We wish you all of the best in your future 
endeavors at the University of Chicago.   

Please contact us if you have any additional 
questions about the selection process.
