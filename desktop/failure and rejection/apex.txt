Hi Simon,

Thank you so much for your interest in 
the RevOps Metcalf Internship with Apex 
Fintech Solutions. We appreciate you 
taking the time to interview with our team.
 
While we were impressed with your skill set, 
particularly regarding your involvement in the 
UChicago community, we have chosen to proceed 
with another candidate who has more leadership experience.
 
Again, we appreciate your time, and 
we wish you the best of luck with 
the rest of the academic year.
