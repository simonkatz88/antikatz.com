Do YOU need film developed?
Are you: tired of Central Camera taking 3 years, 
bellows being pretentious and scratching your negatives, 
CSW never being fucking open during sane hours, 
scared to send negatives in the mail, 
or need you film developed quickly?
Well I have a solution for you. 
I can develop your film. 
$7.50 per roll of 35mm  
$10.00 for a roll of 120
