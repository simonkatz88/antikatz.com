FAQ:

Q: How do I give you my film?
A: For now, contact me directly
and I’ll meet you somewhere on
campus. In the future, I plan to 
also have a drop off box located
in Cobb Cafe. 

Q: What is your turn around time?
A: Worst case, it shouldn’t take 
more than 1 week. If you contact 
me, I can give you an actual answer. 
I process 2 roles at once, so if 
you drop off 2 rolls or a multiple 
of 2 your chance of getting scans 
back quickly increases greatly.

Q:How do your scans compare to lab 
scans(Frontier, Noritsu, etc.) and 
other services?
A: For 35mm film, the ‘scans’ from 
my setup surpass the quality of a lab 
scan in color rendering, dynamic 
range, and detail. If you are 
familiar with a service like 
thedarkroom.com my scans 
contain ~16x as many pixels
as their standard scan and have
roughly the same resolution as
their most expensive tier of scan.

Q: How do you scan negatives? 
A: I ‘scan’ using a Fujifilm X-Pro2, 
Sigma 50mm f/2.8 EX DG Macro Lens, 95+ CRI 
light source, and a Valoi 360 negative 
holder system. 

Q: Do you scan 120/ why the asterisk?
A: My scanning setup is optimized for 
35mm. If you need 120 film scanned, 
contact me to see 120 scanning 
samples and comparisons to other 
scanning methods (virtual drum scanning 
and flatbed scanning). If you think 
my scans are sufficient, scanning 120 
is an additional $5 on top of the 
developing price. 

Q: Do you develop black and 
white, slide (ECN-6), or 
motion picture film (ECN-2)?
A: For the right price anything
can be done. If you supply the 
chemistry and supplies I will 
develop any and all of the listed 
above. However, for ECN-2 and ECN-6 
there will be an additional 
‘this is a massive headache for me’ fee.

Q: What chemistry do you use?
A: I develop using Cinestill’s C41 chemistry.
